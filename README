Harrorth - Learning Haskell, Forth and Parrot - Together.

This project is an auto-didactic experiment about trying to learn three
languages, for the sole purpose of learning the three languages.

It is documented in a tutorial like structure, following the actual process of
the author. In short - I can assume nothing in the begining, because I really
didn't know at the time it was written.

The excercise driving will be implementing a Forth parser, compiler, and
evaluator in Hsakell, and later having this compiler target Parrot.

What I hope to get of the three languages:

	- Haskell
		- Monads
			- IO
				- Interactive
				- Files
			- Storage
		- Tools
			- Parsec
			- GADT
			- C code embedding
				- of parrot
	- Forth
		- The concept in general
	- Parrot
		- The details
			- PMC implementations
			- builtin ops
			- general usage

This project was started out of the frustration of learning haskell in theory.
It is my firm belief, as I write this, that I will get nowhere with haskell
without a real project to drive me.
