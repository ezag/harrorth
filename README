Harrorth - Learning Haskell, Forth and Parrot - Together.

This project is an auto-didactic experiment about trying to learn three
languages, for the sole purpose of learning the three languages.

It is documented in a tutorial like structure, following the actual process of
the author. In short - I can assume nothing in the begining, because I really
didn't know at the time it was written.

This project was started out of the frustration of learning haskell in theory.
It is my firm belief, as I write this, that I will get nowhere with haskell
without a real project to drive me.

It is my hope that by the time I am done, I will know haskell.

Please go to the introduction chapter.
